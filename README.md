RUNNING MANUAL TESTS
------------------------------------------
The app can be used to do manual testing when connecting to a PC for testing. We can specify the phone number and choose the type of call, or enter an SMS message and try sending it. The app will still push data onto the database and we will be able to retrieve this info in the form of graphs and even textual info when necessary.




READING RESULTS
------------------------------
Graphs are available on a web-server and hence, can be viewed either on the PC or on the mobile device having internet access.It is more convenient to view on a PC.
Graphs are classified into various types primarily based on the success rate for calls and SMSes.
